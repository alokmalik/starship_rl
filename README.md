# starship_rl
This is the code for my Reinforcement Learning project in which I implemented:

1. Starship Meteor - A game in pygame in which a spaceship has to surivive for longest amount of time without hitting meteors.
2. Actor Critic with eligibility traces algorithm with fourier basis function for generating features.

There is a project report in this repo and the code for game.
