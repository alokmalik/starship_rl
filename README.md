# starship_rl
This is the code for my Reinforcement Learning project in which I implemented:

1. Starship Meteor - A game in pygame in which a spaceship has to surivive for longest amount of time without hitting meteors.
2. Actor Critic with eligibility traces algorithm with fourier basis function for generating features.

There is a project report in this repo and the code for game. The code for algorithm will be available here after Dec, 1, 2021 as soon as current semester's RL course homework's deadline is passed.
